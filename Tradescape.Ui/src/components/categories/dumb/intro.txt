// Dumb components focus on how things look.

// >>>  UI elements that do not impact the data, only the UI

// Common characteristics of dumb components:
// Focus on the UI Almost all basic UI components should be considered dumb components. Examples include loaders, modals, buttons, inputs, etc.
// Accept props Dumb components accept props to allow them to be dynamic and reusable. For example, you might send the title of a button in props from the parent component to allow it to have a unique name.
// Require no app dependencies Other than UI packages, like Reactstrap, dumb components do not require dependencies.
// Rarely include state The only instance where a dumb component has state is for manipulating the UI itself, not application data. Some examples of where a dumb component might have state would be button groups, tabs, switches and other UI elements that do not impact the data, only the UI.
// Letâ€™s take a look at our sign-in form example from before. Almost every component can be a reusable dumb component including the container, header, inputs and button.
